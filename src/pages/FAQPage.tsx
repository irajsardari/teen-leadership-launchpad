      question: "What is TMA and how is it different from a school?",
      answer: "The Teenagers Management Academy (TMA) is not a school. It is a world-first educational platform that focuses on leadership, emotional intelligence, time and money management, communication, and real-life readiness for teenagers aged 10 to 18. We teach what traditional schools often miss â€” the tools to live, lead, and grow."

      question: "What ages does TMA serve?",

      icon: <Heart className="h-6 w-6" />,
      question: "Is TMA based on a specific educational or religious model?",
      answer: "TMA is values-based and culturally respectful. We combine global best practices in psychology, sociology, leadership, management, and educational science â€” while honoring the ethical and cultural frameworks of each community we serve."
