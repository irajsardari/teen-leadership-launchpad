              <p className="text-lg">
                A quiet observer of people and organizations, Peter Drucker reshaped how the modern world understands work, leadership, and responsibility. He believed management was not about power ‚Äî it was about purpose, people, and performance.

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-16 mb-8">üå± Early Life & Influences</h2>
                <p>
                  Peter Ferdinand Drucker was born in 1909 in Vienna, Austria, into a home filled with books, discussions, and ideas. His father, a senior government official, often hosted intellectual gatherings with economists, scientists, and philosophers ‚Äî among them figures who later influenced Europe's political and cultural direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a teenager, Drucker was deeply curious about how societies organize themselves. He studied law at the University of Frankfurt and later moved to London, where he worked as a journalist. His early years were shaped by the collapse of European stability and the rise of authoritarian systems ‚Äî experiences that taught him how dangerous unexamined power could be.
                </p>
                <p className="font-medium">
                  These early observations later inspired him to ask a question that would define his life's work:<br />
                  <strong>"How can organizations serve humanity rather than control it?"</strong>
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-16 mb-8">üîÅ Turning Point</h2>
                <p>
                  In 1937, Drucker emigrated to the United States to escape Nazi Germany. There, he began teaching and consulting for major corporations. But what changed everything was his deep, human study of <strong>General Motors</strong> ‚Äî one of the world's biggest companies at that time. Unlike others who only measured productivity, Drucker looked at the <em>people behind the machines.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  His 1946 book <em>The Concept of the Corporation</em> revealed that organizations could succeed only if they respected human beings as thinking, responsible individuals ‚Äî not tools. This was the birth of <strong>modern management</strong> as we know it.

                <p>
                  Peter Drucker revolutionized how nations, businesses, and schools see <em>leadership and productivity.</em> He advised CEOs, nonprofits, hospitals, and governments ‚Äî always reminding them that <em>management is about human beings.</em>
                </p>
                <p>His influence spread across disciplines:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                  <li>In <strong>business</strong>, he inspired ethical capitalism.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                  Today, nearly every MBA program in the world still begins with Drucker's principles.
