                Steve Jobs was an American entrepreneur, inventor, and visionary whose pursuit of perfection transformed the way the world experiences technology. As co-founder of Apple Inc., he revolutionized personal computing, music, animation, and mobile communication by infusing soul into technology ‚Äî insisting that design should not just look good but feel right.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Born in 1955 in San Francisco, Jobs dropped out of college but never abandoned learning. His curiosity for design, calligraphy, and Zen philosophy later shaped the simplicity and clarity that became Apple's identity.
