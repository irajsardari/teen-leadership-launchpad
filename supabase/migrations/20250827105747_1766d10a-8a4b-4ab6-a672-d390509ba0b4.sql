-- Fix critical security vulnerabilities: Restrict access to sensitive personal data
-- This migration addresses multiple ERROR level security findings by ensuring sensitive tables
-- are only accessible to authenticated users with proper authorization

-- 1. Revoke all permissions from anonymous users on sensitive tables
REVOKE ALL ON public.challengers FROM anon;
REVOKE ALL ON public.teacher_applications FROM anon;
REVOKE ALL ON public.safeguarding_reports FROM anon;
REVOKE ALL ON public.confidential_records FROM anon;
REVOKE ALL ON public.parental_consents FROM anon;
REVOKE ALL ON public.consent_permissions FROM anon;
REVOKE ALL ON public.profiles FROM anon;

-- 2. Update RLS policies to explicitly target authenticated users only
-- Drop existing policies and recreate them with proper authentication checks
